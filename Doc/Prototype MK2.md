# Prototype MK2

The [prototype MK1](Prototype%20MK1.md) has many issues. We need to improve through iteration.

Firstly, there is a stability problem. This is mainly due to the hard water pipes that generated high stress when bending, cracking open the glue of the water reservoir level. By using specialized right-angle elbow fittings for the bends, and let the pipe run straight.

The second problem is too much manual work involved. By using 3D printing, we build [adapters](/3DModel) to mount parts. Most of them has screw holes on sides with a diameter of 4.5mm, which can accommodate imperial #8 or metric M4 screws. The platform is made by medium density fiberboard (MDF), which measures 20x30 centimeters. The water block and the cooling plate are put in a 3D printed [housing](/3DModel/CoolingPlateHousing.stl), attached directly to the platform. The water reservoir has an [adapter](/3DModel/WaterReservoirAdapter.stl), and the water pump has a [baseplate](/3DModel/PumpBaseplate.stl). They are mounted on top of PVC pipes to the upper platform.

The heat exchangers are replaced by radiators from water cooling system of computers. Fans are mounted on it, in different facings. The 3D printed adapter reduces the 12cm radiator to 1-1/2 inch pipe. A dust filter can be installed on the inlet side.

The pipes are mounted on the lower platform by braskets. The center of the platform has a hole for tee fitting to go through.

Assemble them together, this is our MK2. We use pipes as the frame, MDF as platforms, and 3D printed parts as adapters.

## Conclusion

In MK2, the only manual work is pipe fitting and drilling. It's much compact than before, with better replicability and stability. Problems in MK1 have been solved. In the next iteration, we'll build the circuit part, and start the overall testing.
