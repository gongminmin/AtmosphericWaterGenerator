# Prototype MK1

The prototype MK1 is the initial attempt for sorting out the components and the frame. It's basically built from cardboard, fish tank pump, water pipe, etc.

The top level is the place for two water reservoirs.

The left and right side of the second level are two water pumps. In the middle, two water blocks sandwiching a cooling plate.

The airflow pipe is built from 1-1/2-inch ABS drainpipe. On the tip, it's a 2 inch to 1-1/2-inch reducer. The two elbow are 60 degree's ones. And a tee fitting is in the middle. Each arm is ~25cm. And in the horizontal section, components are connected by two 4cm pipe.

The fan is housed inside a cardboard tube, by iron wires. The tube is 2-inch in diameter, can be mounted to the tip of the pipe.

Inside each arm, a condenser coil is in place. It's made by wrapping a 3-meter-long refrigerator tube on a 3/4-inch pipe.

Unfortunately, the outside diameter of the refrigerator tube is 1/8-inch, but all the rests are in 8mm or 5/16 inch. To connect them, we have to use 5/16 to 3/16 converters, and wrap a thick layer of adhesive tape on the outside of the tube.

## Conclusion

After the build, there are a lot of problems floating up.

* It's so fragile, easy to break down.
* Too many manual work.
* Big and heavy

In the next iteration, they'll be improved.
